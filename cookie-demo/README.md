## `Cookies`
```html
The main purpose of a cookie is to identify users and
possibly prepare customized Web pages or to save information.
```
<br>

## `Some Types:`
    
### `1. Session` 
```html
- Is destroyed after browser close
```

### `2. Permanent` 
```html
- Has max-age or expiry set, can live after browser close
```

### `3. httponly` 
```html
- Can only be set from server
- Browser cannot read and get with document.cookie; 
- This cookie is also sent with every req
- Can be used for, tokens; session-id (if you don't want it to be stolen)
```

### `4. Secure` 
```html
- Only for https sites
```

### `5. Third party` 
```html
- External cookies that track users eg: IP address, website...  
- eg. ads/ vids or imgs from other sites embedded in your blog (google/ youtube)
- Your blog will set cookies for your site/domain.
- These ads/ vids/ img component will make req to third party domain 
  eg. google analytics and they will set their own cookies in your site.
- These cookies cannot be accessed from your site, vice versa but are sitting in your site/domain.
```

### `6. Zombie` 
```html
- Is recreated with same values even after being deleted; e-tags from the server 
- ETag (entity tag) response header provides a mechanism to cache unchanged resources
- 304 Not Modified is an HTTP status code that is returned to the client 
  when the cached copy of a particular file is up to date with the server. 
- When a client such as a browser stores something in cache, 
  it also keeps the Last-Modified header sent from the server
```
<br>
    
## `Scope`
- Cookie scope are defined by it's domain eg. `abc.com` || `www.abc.com`
- This sets and include all sub domain: `document.cookie = "a=1; domain=.abc.com "`
- Cookies are sent with every req related to the domain (cookies contain all the info)
- HTTP is stateless and server stores nothing 
   
<br>
    
 ## `Security`
 ### `Stealing cookies, inject XSS script:`
 ```html
- Having a client side js program that reads your cookie (document.cookie) and send it else where
- eg. if you click any link and your cookie is not set same-site, the browser will send that cookie GET req
 
- GET req should always be read only to server
- POST is used instead to submit any data to be changed
- Hacker donâ€™t want your cookie, they just want to make a request on your behalf 
  using your cookie while you are signed in to your bank and will inject a script 
  that makes a request on your bank to transfer themselves money in the same site/url
```
